# Notes:
# - Create three repository secrets: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME
# - The API token requires "Pages:Edit" and "Account:Read" permissions for the target account.
# - Alternatively, you can connect Pages directly in the Cloudflare dashboard and set build command to
#   `npm ci && npm run build` with output directory `dist` — this workflow provides CI-triggered deploys
#   from GitHub and keeps build artifacts out of the repository.
